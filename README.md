# WorkStation-Design

The following Repository will include personal Setup builds for home and work along with ideas for other peoples done with 3d design and building

In this Github there will be Two Foldered Categories ie; Personal, and Work
with the following subcategories ie; Ideas, Design, and Built.

The process will only be a compilation of photos and a few list providing the Components and Accessories such as; Desk, Monitors, Mouse/Keyboards.
This will all be provided in the final render as it will be shown in its entirety.

There will be a seperate folder labled Computers, with sub folders; Intel, AMD, Apple, or Linux.
And will host the computer corresponding build for each setup as I may use a particular build more then once.

My 3D Rendering skills with Blender are still at sub par so many ideas will take me longer to full render as time goes on hopefully things get smoother 
and I'm able to produce faster and more efficiently!
